                    <h2>Testing Approaches</h2>
                    <p>Different ways of experiencing and slicing your product up:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="fragment"><strong>Manual</strong>. Slow, error prone, human required.</li>
                        <li class="fragment"><strong>Unit</strong>. Testing code at the granular unit/module/class level.</li>
                        <li class="fragment"><strong>Visual</strong>. Does it look like what it's supposed to look like?</li>
                        <li class="fragment"><strong>Integration</strong>. Once you put all the pieces together, does it work?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="fragment">Today we will be focussing on unit testing and integration/end-to-end testing specifically for PhoneGap apps.</p>

                    <h2>Before we begin...</h2>

                      I have a branch of the sample app up on my fork that has all the various testing bits included. I will be walking through that code and demoing it throughout the workshop. Grab it if you don't already have it!

                    <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
                    <p>Testing the building blocks that make up your app, one block (or <em>unit</em>) at a time.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">The driving assumption is that the majority of quality problems in your application come from <em>your</em> code/logic.</p>
                    <h3 class="fragment">Therefore, we focus unit tests on your application's logic.</h3>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        should be focused on JUST the logic of your units. so, really disassembling your app into smaller parts we can test individually.
                        its expected that the programming languages / frameworks / programs you leverage as dependencies that make up your app (phoengap, cordova, the browser) are well tested and works. the assumption is that the main contributors to errors/failure in your app is YOUR code. so focus on testing YOUR code first and foremost.

                    <h2>Unit Testing, cont.</h2>
                    <p>As the first line of defense against bugs and regressions, we want unit tests to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="fragment">Be easy to run, since we will run them all the time during development.</li>
                        <li class="fragment">Be fast. Slow unit tests make me less likely to run them.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        the second part (fast unit tests) actually enforces the principle of isolation: any kind of i/o will slow your test.

                    <p class="fragment">The logic in your code mostly exists in JavaScript.</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        this is a single-page app, and all of the app's logic is contained within a single JS file. if your app's source is split among multiple files, the same approach I will be dtailing applies to you, too. the single-js-file scenario is generally trickier to test properly than a more modular approach.

                    <h2>Requirement 1</h2>
                    <h4>Environment for our JavaScript</h4>
                    <p class="fragment">To start, follow the installation guide to get all the Karma pieces in place - let's run through it quickly.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Let me walk through the Karma config to explain how Karma loads our app's JS.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        cover basepath, files, browsers, autowatch and single run. we will turn autowatch on and single run off so that we can
                        focus/optimize on the app development experience. that is, as an app developer making changes to my code, how do i streamline
                        the test-running experience to help my development efforts. i will show that in a sec.
                        remember that the order of the files we include matter. in this case, our app relies on Framework7. so we need to include framework7
                        FIRST - just like in the browser! similarly, our tests rely on our own app code, so our tests get included last.
                        another common gotcha is coupling the logic (JS) to the view (HTML/document). some simple tweaks to the basic structure of our app let us
                        decouple the javascript from the document almost entirely. let me show you how that's done in the star track app case - there is a single init()
                        call that kicks off finding DOM elements, binding to their events, that kinda stuff.

                        i like to organize describe blocks by module or function that i am testing, and have each test exercise one aspect of my code.
                        open up karma config again. show frameworks. we're using jasmine, so we tell karma "expect to run jasmine tests now", k?

                    <p class="fragment">Recall that unit testing relies on isolating our logic to small units.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">This can make executing code that is <strong>highly coupled</strong> to other units difficult.</p>
                    <p class="fragment"><strong>Mocking</strong> is a technique where we use software dummies to stand-in for other units, dependencies or even function parameters in order to keep tests <em>focussed</em>. </p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        also called stubbing. lets look at the second set of tests that depict this technique, in increasingly more complex unit tests. the second set of tests exercise the javascript function responsible for doing the search: it'll validate the input, make an API call to spotify to search for music, delegate rendering of the results to another function, and finally handle any errors during the call to the spotify api. That's at least four tests, if not more.

                    <p>What we want is an <strong>automated</strong> way to replace UI interactions.</p>
                    <p>In that sense, it is the opposite of unit testing with <em>mocking</em>:</p>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        integration testing treats your entire application as one giant package, with everything included: UI, integrations with other API/services. in other words, _nothing_ is mocked - which is completely the opposite from what we did during unit testing. that introduces its own challenges, but the benefit is we are testing and playing with a version of the software that is identical, or very close, to what our users will be using.
                        HEAVY! expensive, slow. if you dont need to do integration testing, dont do it. generally, the larger the project and the longer it has been around, the more likely you need integration testing.

                        first, let’s install it, and something called a selenium-server and chromedriver: npm install nightwatch selenium-server chromedriver —save-dev.
                        our first integration testing environment will be a browser (chrome, in this case). and, just like how in our development loop / workflow, we test
                        often using `phonegap serve` and loading up the browser, we will leverage this same approach to run integration tests in chrome.
                        this will be a stepping stone to running these integration tests on mobile.
                        lets go over the nightwatch config to see whats in there. lets cover the basic setup, the selenium server and chromedriver bits, and the default test environment.

                        we also need to write what im calling a ‘runner’ script - something that gives us the flexbility to set up the testing environment in such a way that it works for our phonegap app. in particular, the runner script will run `phonegap serve` for us, and once its running, only then will it kick off nightwatch.
                        it will also help run some extra processes to test inside mobile emulators, but i will show that off in a bit.

                       even though the automation API is identical, the app running inside a browser vs running inside a native app container are two vastly different contexts. two main differences:
                            1. there is no concept of URL loading in a cordova app. so explicitly loading the URL is not needed, and in fact would probably fail.
                            2. phonegap apps are native apps, but your app lives inside what is called a webview within the native application. so when automating the UI of a phonegap app, we need to have the tests find this webview and _change the context of the UI automation to the webview.

                        <p>We can easily factor out this difference in environments using a <code>before</code> clause in our tests. Let's take a look.</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        so we need to tweak the tests such that the browser context and the native app context are both handled. we can do so by factoring out these differences into test scripts that run before/after all the tests, or each of the tests.
                        lets also show the different mobile environments we are testing in the nightwatch config, and how our runner script will start appium for us. note how we are pointing our test runner to the final built native binaries - we are literally testing what we eventuall ship to our customers.
                        worth noting that we probably want to build a new mobile binary before running the tests - to package up any changes and test those, too.
