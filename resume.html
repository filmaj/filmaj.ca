<h2><span class="material-icons">rowing</span>Developer / Director</h2>
<details>
    <summary>I'm a web, mobile and systems developer with 15 years of experience, some as a director of engineering. My working tenets are open source, web technologies, testing and automation. A theme in my work has been a focus on developer tooling and developer experience.</summary>
    <p>I started as a web developer and learned various other programming paradigms when mobile exploded in North America in 2008. I was one of the core developers of <a href="https://phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a>, a hybrid mobile application framework bridging the gap between web and mobile development. This work eventually led to <a href="https://news.adobe.com/press-release/adobe-creative-cloud-dps/adobe-announces-agreement-acquire-nitobi-creator-phonegap">an acquisition by Adobe</a>.</p>
    <p>In 2013, I joined <a href="https://saucelabs.com">Sauce Labs</a> and worked on a large scale testing-as-a-service product. I gained experience with networking and systems in order to manage fleets of thousands of <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>s, containers, machines and mobile phones running in data centers. Our work enabled millions of developers to test their code at scale. In 2015 I shifted to management and eventually directed an office of 25 people, ensuring multiple engineering teams performed at a high level while focussing on people happiness.</p>
    <p>In 2016, I decided to take a break from management and went back to coding - it is what I love to do - and ran an <a href="https://medium.com/adobetech/how-adobe-is-changing-its-culture-around-open-source-c9c7daa6dc2a"><b>Open Source Program Office</b></a> back at <a href="https://adobe.com">Adobe</a>. In the summer of 2019 I switched roles and became Community Manager on the <a href="https://marketplace.magento.com/partner/engcom">Community Engineering Team</a> at <a href="https://magento.com">Magento</a>, which had been recently acquired by Adobe.</p>
    <p>In early 2020, I left Magento and Adobe to take a break and until the summer of 2021 I was consulting and doing freelance data analysis and software development for AWS at Amazon, <a href="https://begin.com">Begin</a> and others.</p>
    <p>In the summer of 2021 I joined <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> as part of their Developer Relations Engineering team as a staff engineer, where I have worked on their <a href="https://api.slack.com/automation">developer platform</a>, focussing on developer tooling like Slack's <a href="https://api.slack.com/automation/cli/quick-reference">platform CLI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/slackapi">open source application SDKs</a> like <a href="https://slack.dev">Bolt</a> and their <a href="https://github.com/slackapi/deno-slack-sdk">next-generation platform Deno SDK</a>.

        <details>
            <summary>In July 2019, I joined the <a href="https://opensource.magento.com">Community Engineering</a> team at <a href="https://magento.com">Magento</a> - an <a href="https://adobe.com">Adobe</a> company. My responsibilities comprised of project management, training and public relations.</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>Project Management: there are several community projects that make up the <a href="https://magento.com">Magento</a> ecosystem, not least of which was the core project, <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2">magento2</a>, but this also included projects like <a href="https://github.com/magento/inventory">MSI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration">Adobe Stock Integration</a>. I coordinated between the corporation and the community to push project evolution forward, ensured release deadlines were met while including the third party development community every step of the way.</li>
                <li>Training: getting a dedicated team working elbow-to-elbow with and coordinating a massive third party developer community to build software together has its limits. <a href="https://magento.com">Magento</a> realizes this. As a result, internal teams at <a href="https://magento.com">Magento</a> were trained on how to work with the community in a transparent way. I was responsible for assembling the curriculum and running the training sessions.</li>
                <li>Public Relations: I managed social media channels for our team, such as the <a href="https://twitter.com/magentoengcom">Community Engineering Twitter account</a> and our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUsdK3NnJ0LqhNJCrJDdiug">YouTube Channel</a>. I also helped with writing posts on the <a href="https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/bg-p/devblog">Magento DevBlog</a>.</li>

            <summary>In November of 2016, I rejoined Adobe and together with a few co-workers from the <a href="https://phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a> team formed Adobe's Developer Experience team. We worked to improve <a href="https://adobe.com">Adobe</a>'s developer ecosystem, both <a href="https://adobe.io">externally</a> and internally. These efforts helped double the number of active <a href="https://github.com/adobe">Adobians on GitHub</a> from 2017 to 2018.</summary>
            <p>I was focussed on increasing collaboration across teams, departments and organizations inside the corporation by influencing the environment we work in: by <a href="https://www.cio.com/section/3395460/how-and-why-adobe-is-making-open-source-a-strategic-priority.html">promoting open source and helping nurture open development practices internally by helping evolve Adobe's Open Source Office</a>, <a href="/presentations/adobe-oss-eu-2018">influencing the developer experience of Adobe's nascent platform offerings to push adoption forward</a>, <a href="https://github.com/filmaj/oss-contributors">tracking tech company involvement in open source</a> as well as redesigning and developing Adobe's new developer portal. We also built various tools and resources to help Adobians be productive in open source: we built a <a href="https://github.com/adobe/cla-bot">serverless-powered GitHub App, Adobe's CLA Bot</a>, to check that contributors signed <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/cla.html">Adobe's CLA</a>, evolved an <a href="https://github.com/adobe/starter-repo">Adobe open source starter repo</a> and put together <a href="https://github.com/adobe/open-development-template">documentation templates for open source projects in order to formalize their goals, workflow and governance</a> to help attract contributors. Lastly, one of my responsibilities on this team was helping provide feedback on the <a href="https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home.html">Adobe Experience Platform</a>'s Content Services <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> and build starter resources for this <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> like tutorials and code samples.</p>

            <p>I veered away from focusing on mobile development exclusively in my time at <a href="http://saucelabs.com">Sauce Labs</a>. I gained valuable experience managing fleets of both bare-metal and virtual machines of various operating systems (Linux, Windows and Mac) powering Sauce's testing service. I learned how to build and run a distributed, highly-available system, shifting my focus towards design and maintenance of systems, from hardware up to software, from operational to programming concerns.</p>
