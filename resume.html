    <h2><i class="material-icons">rowing</i>Generalist Staff Developer / Director of Engineering</h2>
    <details>
        <summary><b>TL;DR:</b> I'm a generalist web, mobile and systems developer with years of engineering management experience. My working tenets are open source, web technologies, testing and automation.</summary>
        I started as a web developer and learned various other programming paradigms when mobile exploded in the mid-2000s. I was one of the core developers of <a href="https://phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a>, a hybrid mobile application framework bridging the gap between web and mobile development. This work eventually led to <a href="https://news.adobe.com/press-release/adobe-creative-cloud-dps/adobe-announces-agreement-acquire-nitobi-creator-phonegap">an acquisition by Adobe</a>. In the early 2010s, I joined <a href="https://saucelabs.com">Sauce Labs</a> and worked on a large scale testing-as-a-service product and gained experience with networking and systems in order to manage fleets of thousands of VMs, containers, machines and mobile phones running in data centers, enabling millions of developers to test their code at scale. In 2015 I shifted to management and eventually directed an IT office of 25 people, ensuring multiple engineering teams perform at a high level while focussing on people happiness. In 2016 I decided to take a break from management and went back to coding - it is what I love to do - and ran an <a href="https://medium.com/adobetech/how-adobe-is-changing-its-culture-around-open-source-c9c7daa6dc2a"><b>Open Source Program Office</b></a> back at <a href="https://adobe.com">Adobe</a>. In the summer of 2019 I switched roles and became Community Manager on the <a href="https://marketplace.magento.com/partner/engcom">Community Engineering Team</a> at <a href="https://magento.com">Magento</a>, which had been recently acquired by Adobe. In early 2020 I left Magento and Adobe to take a break and since the summer of 2020 until the summer of 2021 I was consulting and doing freelance data analysis and software development for AWS at Amazon, <a href="https://begin.com">Begin</a> and others. In the summer of 2021 I joined <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> as part of their DevRel Tools team as a staff engineer!

        <h1><i class="material-icons">assessment</i>Proficiencies &amp; Languages</h1>
        <p>I pride myself most on my ability to learn new languages, frameworks, and methodologies quickly. Technology is constantly evolving and language fluency is, in my opinion, a professional programming necessity.</p>
        <p><b>Programming languages:</b> I am confident in JavaScript, Java, C/C++, C#, Python, sh and Ruby, and can get by in PHP, Go, Objective-C and Haskell.</p>
        <details>
            <summary><b>TL;DR:</b> I've worked with a variety of technologies and have expertise in node.js, all different kinds of cloud developer services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) (but particularly enjoying functions-as-a-service), all things web (both frontend and backend), .NET, Ruby on Rails, relational and document databases, infrastructure-as-code and mobile development for both Android and iOS. I have architected complex distributed systems written as monoliths or microservices.</summary>
            <p>A deeper dive into some of my favourite technologies:</p>
            <ul>

                        <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> for chopping up compute workloads into discrete functions working in unison</li>
                        <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">AWS DynamoDB</a> as a new, different and performant way of persisting and querying data</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I live and breathe the web and am a huge proponent of it, so I have deep understanding of DNS, HTTP, REST and browsers; it is my platform of delivery of choice</li>
                <li>Full stack frameworks like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/">Microsoft .NET</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a></li>

                <li>Document databases using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">AWS DynamoDB</a>, <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a> and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">ElasticSearch</a></li>

                <li>Mobile development on <a href="https://developer.android.com">Android</a>, along with a good understanding of the <a href="https://source.android.com">Android Open Source Project</a>, all the way down to the kernel, as well as proficiency with using <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk">Android's NDK</a></li>
                <li>I have developed native <a href="https://developer.apple.com">iOS applications</a></li>

I gained valuable experience managing fleets of both bare-metal and virtual machines of various operating systems (Linux, Windows and Mac) powering Sauce's testing service. I learned how to build and run a distributed, highly-available system, shifting my focus towards (<i>cringe</i>) DevOps, that is, design and maintenance of systems, from hardware up to software, from operational to programming concerns.</p>

                            <p>I was focussed on increasing collaboration across teams, departments and organizations inside the corporation by influencing the environment we work in: by <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3395460/how-and-why-adobe-is-making-open-source-a-strategic-priority.html">promoting open source and helping nurture open development practices internally by helping evolve Adobe's Open Source Office</a>, <a href="/presentations/adobe-oss-eu-2018">influencing the developer experience of Adobe's nascent platform offerings to push adoption forward</a>, <a href="https://github.com/filmaj/oss-contributors">tracking tech company involvement in open source</a> as well as redesigning and developing Adobe's new developer portal. We also built various tools and resources to help Adobians be productive in open source: we built a <a href="https://github.com/adobe/cla-bot">serverless-powered GitHub App, Adobe's CLA Bot</a>, to check that contributors signed <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/cla.html">Adobe's CLA</a>, evolved an <a href="https://github.com/adobe/starter-repo">Adobe open source starter repo</a> and put together <a href="https://github.com/adobe/open-development-template">documentation templates for open source projects in order to formalize their goals, workflow and governance</a> to help attract contributors. <b>These efforts helped double the number of active <a href="https://github.com/adobe">Adobians on GitHub</a> from 2017 to 2018</b>. Lastly, one of my responsibilities on this team was helping provide feedback on the <a href="https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home.html">Adobe Experience Platform</a>'s Content Services API and build starter resources for this API like tutorials and code samples.</p>

My responsibilities comprised of project management, training and public relations.</summary>

                                <li><b>Training</b>: getting a dedicated team working elbow-to-elbow with and coordinating a massive third party developer community to build software together has its limits. <a href="https://magento.com">Magento</a> realizes this.
