if your product/brand/business was built on the web, and app stores are an extension, not core to your strategy, then this approach makes sense

* web is good at a lot of shit right now, but not all
 * 3d graphics (but webgl coming and runs great on new BlackBerries, so who knows)
* "stuck" in the phonegap api.. sorta
